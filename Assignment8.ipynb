Provide an example of each.\n","\n",":- Built-in functions are readily available within the python library and have a preset purpose. Examples of built-in functions include print (), input (), list (), dict (), int (), str (), all (), sum (), sqrt (), etc.\n","\n","User-defined functions are created and defined by the user. Examples of user-defined functions include a function to add two numbers, or a function to display factorial of a number."],"metadata":{"id":"X1u7DZshkeDw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2:- How can you pass arguments to a function in Python? Explain the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n","\n",":- To pass arguments to a function in Python, you can use two methods1:\n","\n","By Position: Positional arguments do not have keywords and are assigned first.\n","\n","By Keyword: Keyword arguments have keywords and are assigned second, after positional arguments. Note that you have the option to use positional arguments.\n","\n","Positional arguments are passed to a function in the order they are defined in the function signature. Keyword arguments are passed with a keyword and a value, and can be passed in any order. When calling a function with * and **, the former tuple is expanded as if the parameters were passed separately and the latter dictionary is expanded as if they were keyword parameters."],"metadata":{"id":"0F4VOXOkkxAX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3:- What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? Can a function have multiple return statements? Explain with an example.\n","\n",":- The purpose of the return statement in a function is to stop the execution of that particular function. A function can have multiple return statements, but only inside conditional blocks. It only makes sense to have multiple return statements if there are multiple paths for the code, for example, if the function has an if statement with different return statements for each of the if/else if/else blocks."],"metadata":{"id":"novFThKhl9Lz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4:- What are lambda functions in Python? How are they different from regular functions? Provide an example where a lambda function can be useful.\n","\n",":- Python lambda functions are anonymous functions, meaning they have no name. They are defined with the lambda keyword, followed by any number of arguments and one expression."],"metadata":{"id":"Lh7DnnmPmY5x"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5:- How does the concept of \"scope\" apply to functions in Python? Explain the difference between local scope and global scope.\n","\n",":- Scope in Python refers to the area of code where variables can be used1234. There are two general scopes in Python:\n","Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.\n","Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.\n","Variables can only reach the area in which they are defined. By default, all variables declared in a function are local variables"],"metadata":{"id":"eetve6WKnAxA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6:- How can you use the \"return\" statement in a Python function to return multiple values?\n","\n",":- The Python return statement is a key component of functions and methods.

If you modify what you passed, it will not affect the original variable.\n","- In \"pass by reference\", the actual parameter is passed to the function. This means that what you passed is a reference to the original variable directly, and modifying it modifies the original variable as well."],"metadata":{"id":"kUfl8ZpknQ6Q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8:- Create a function that takes a full name as an argument and returns first name and last name.\n","\n",":-  The .split() function which returns a list of strings after splitting by a separator.
