    "It is one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming, along with encapsulation and polymorphism. \n",
    "Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes relationships between classes.\n",
    "It allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its redundancy. \n",

    "Single inheritance is one in which the derived class inherits the single base class either public, private, or protected access specifier.\n",
    "In single inheritance, the derived class uses the features or members of the single base class.\n",
    "These base class members can be accessed by a derived class or child class according to the access specifier specified while inheriting the parent class or base class.\n",

    "Multiple Inheritance:- \n",
    "    \n",
    "Multiple inheritance is one in which the derived class acquires two or more base classes. \n",
    "In multiple inheritance, the derived class is allowed to use the joint features of the inherited base classes.\n",

    "    The new class is called the derived (child) class, and the class from which it inherits is called the base (parent) class. \n",
    "    The base class is also called a superclass. The derived class inherits features from the base class, and new features can be added to it, resulting in re-usability of code."

    "    It enables the reuse of code by allowing subclasses to inherit functionality from their parent classes, which promotes the reuse of code and reduces duplication. \n",
