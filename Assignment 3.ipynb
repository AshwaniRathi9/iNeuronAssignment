You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result."],"metadata":{"id":"m9dH0GER4jny"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3: What statement creates a function?\n","\n",":- In Python, define a function with the def keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon."],"metadata":{"id":"O1aKOqzT5dwA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4: What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n","\n",":- The Function which calls another Function is called Calling Function and the function which is called by another Function is called a Called Function."],"metadata":{"id":"geIYYfyE54yA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5: How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n","\n",":-  At any given time during execution, you'll have at most four active Python scopes—local, enclosing, global, and built-in—depending on where you are in the code. On the other hand, you'll always have at least two active scopes, which are the global and built-in scopes."],"metadata":{"id":"Yvy1gkMn6k-f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6: What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n","\n",":- The variable y only exists while the function is being executed — we call this its lifetime. When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed. Codelens helps you visualize this because the local variables disappear after the function returns."],"metadata":{"id":"j7pM60887N_w"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7: What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n","\n",":- A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs."],"metadata":{"id":"pGZ9DM4w7n__"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8: If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n","\n",":- None"],"metadata":{"id":"jP1GAG2f76pN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9: How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n","\n",":- use the global keyword"],"metadata":{"id":"h4WZjdcv8Hpv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10: What is the data type of None?\n","\n",":- The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all.
